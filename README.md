Project Description: Contact Book Application The Contact Book Application is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) program built using the tkinter library in Python. Its purpose is to allow users to manage their contacts by adding, deleting, and viewing contact details. Here are the key features of the application:

User Interface:

The application provides a clean and intuitive interface with input fields for entering contact names and phone numbers. Users can add new contacts by filling in both name and phone number fields and clicking the “Add Contact” button. Existing contacts are displayed in a listbox, allowing users to select and view details.

Functionality:

Add Contact: Users can input a contact’s name and phone number, and upon clicking the “Add Contact” button, the contact is added to the list.

Delete Contact: Users can select a contact from the list and click the “Delete Contact” button to remove it.

View Contact Details: Clicking on a contact in the listbox displays its details (name and phone number) in the input fields for editing or reference.

Clear Contacts: The “Clear Contacts” button clears the entire contact list.

Error Handling:

If a user attempts to add a contact without providing both a name and a phone number, an error message is displayed. Similarly, if no contact is selected for deletion, an error message alerts the user.

Event Handling:

The application responds to user interactions, such as selecting a contact from the listbox or clicking buttons.

Usability:

The application is designed for ease of use, making it suitable for personal use or small-scale contact management. Users can quickly add, edit, and delete contacts without navigating complex menus.
